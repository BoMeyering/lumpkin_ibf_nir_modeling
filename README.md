# lumpkin_ibf_nir_modeling
This repo contains the NIR spectral data and modeling code for all Illinois Bundleflower historical collections from The Land Institute.

## Data
* Spectral data collected on IBF samples grown out in a field trial - a total of 588 scans. Tissue was dried and processed with a 10mm knife, scanned, reprocessed with a 1mm knife and then scanned again.
* A select number of samples were sent off for wet chemistry. Selected samples using the Kennard Stone algorithm after preprocessing using a Savitsky-Golay filter and taking the second derivative.
